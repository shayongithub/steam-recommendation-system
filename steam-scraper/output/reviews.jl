Very little to salvage.\nThe graphics are bad, but in a management game that will easily get a free pass. Transport Tycoon had worse graphics (not much, maybe slightly worse, but worse), and it still is one of my favorite games ever, so let's put that down as an \"average\" mark, 5/10.\nSound is frankly appalling. A short loop as music, cringeworthy sound effect on random actions. Some of them I feel are ripped straight from some 1970s German porn movie. 1/10, and I am being generous\nThe strategy approach at first sparks a glimpse of interest: managing the routes and tasks of every vehicle in the fleet, connecting different post offices... maybe we have something good here? in short, NO.\nThere are 6 vehicle tasks, one of them basically useless. The type of vehicle limits the range and load available for the job, but the steep difference in price and the unlock cost make it a slow unbearable agony getting anything other than a motobike or basic car.\nManagement of the post office is basic to the point of being insulting. The upgrades have practically no effect and -once you buy all 9 employees- office management is over.\nStarting funds are limited (rightfully so), but even by wisely spending them all, building either one large office or two interconnected medium ones, or three small ones, money trickle in so slowly that playing the game is a pointless waiting task. It could be an idle game, save for the fact that sometimes you have to click to proceed to the next day.\nOne week into the game you may have been able to buy an extra car or two, or better yet repair stations for all your offices. The next step would be a new office but -I assure you- you will drop the game well before this happens.\nYou may be gaining 3000 a day, and it takes 35k+ to set up a new office. Playing for 10 in-game days, even if played at fastest speed, is as fun as having your hand crushed into a meat grinder.\nLet's say the gameplay is a 2/10 overall, a score bumped up only by the lack of alternative in postal managament games.\nThis game shows a utter and complete lack of balancing, playtesting or refinement. It is extremely clear it has been abandoned mid-development and rushed to finish it to a quasi-working condition.\nThe only players who can possibly enjoy this are comatose patients with an OCD and a lifelong passion for post offices, but I feel it is a very small -even if totally untapped- market niche.\nPlease do yourself a solid, avoid this dumpst... postbox fire, and spend your 5‚Ç¨ in something more fast-paced such as a stamps collection or a pet rock.", "hours": 1.3, "user_id": "76561197980248095", "username": "cantoni.federico", "products": 376, "early_access": false}

The less programs I have open suits me just fine, and Steam barely even opens when it's supposed to open.\nLet me give an example for the uninitiated and those living in willful ignorance: The RPG Maker series uses character classes. Y'know, fighter, mage, cleric, etc. But it doesn't give an in-built menu with the program to change those classes easily. You have to event it. It's this shortsightedness that has cemented Enterbrain, or ASCII, or whatever these obstinate, minimum-effort drones call themselves these days.\nIf you want to have a game with any functionality beyond a Dragon Quest clone, then you're gonna have to scrounge around and backup all the scripts you can find, unless you want to devote a decade of your life to learning the obscure programming language that is Ruby. Programming is a detail-oriented skill, and these \"detail-oriented\" people had the foresight to not properly curate or permit redistribution of their scripts, so in a few years it'll all be 404 links clogging up search engines. I guess they consider their hard work to be disposable like that.\nDo yourself a favor don't get this until you've absolutely outlined your project from start to finish and know all the tools you'll need beforehand, because otherwise you'll have been overcharged (even ten bucks is a laugh for the limited resources the program comes bundled with) just to release a half-finished game, or else to not release anything at all.

{"product_id": "230820", "page": 1, "page_order": 3, "recommended": true, "date": "1 January", "text": "The Night of the Rabbit is a point and click adventure game by Daedalic Entertainment. In this game, you play as Jerry Hazelnut, a young boy who gets to go on a magical adventure at the end of his summer vacation. He gets transported to a world of magic and animals and begins his training as a magician.\nThe Night of the Rabbit is a pretty typical point and click adventure game. You walk around, talk to characters, and collect items to solve puzzles. I thought the puzzles were more or less reasonable, although a bit on the more difficult side. I definitely needed to refer to a guide in a few places, but the puzzles never felt nonsensical. The game doesn't really have a hint system, although the first spell you learn is introduced as if it was supposed to be one. The advice seeker spell is only usable in part of the game and the only clues I got were extremely general and unhelpful. There is one major minigame, a card game called Quartets. You only have to play it once, but you can choose to play it with most of the characters you meet, and I found myself playing it a lot, even though it didn't do anything to move the story along.\nI really enjoyed the story. Jerry is a pretty likeable protagonist, and I enjoyed spending time with him and the people of Mousewood and following along on his adventures. It did take a little while to get into the story, however, and there was a period near the beginning of the game where I couldn't really figure out what I was supposed to be doing and the story didn't really feel like it was moving. However, most of the game was much easier to follow and moved along at a good pace.\nThe story, art, and music combine to make a charming, fairy tale atmosphere, and I really enjoyed it. There was a point where I thought that the game was going to get more dark/bleak, and there was one type of twist in particular that I was expecting, but fortunately, it didn't go where I thought it was going and I ended up really enjoying the ending.\nOverall, The Night of the Rabbit was a really enjoyable adventure. I had a good time playing it, for the most part, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys point and clicks, especially fans of Daedalic's other games, like The Whispered World or Anna's Quest. 8/10", "hours": 17.2, "user_id": "76561198218582012", "username": "The Greater Sphinx", "products": 418, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

This was really the first of the Portal clones and after the original came out I was desperate for\nwith a similar style. Where Twin Sector really falls down is that the timings needed to pull off a solution successfully are often very precise and hand be somewhat haphazard depending on certain random elements. It is incredibly frustrating to know the solution to a puzzle, but have to try it again and again because your timing was just a millisecond off. The physics for pickup up and throwing objects are really not good and fighting the turrets you come across is mostly a game of \"throw stuff at it over and over again until it breaks\".\nAnd that's a shame because near the end the puzzles got a bit better and as things got closer to the ending I did find myself legitimately getting invested in the story and characters despite largely being a more serious near beat-for-beat retelling of Portal.

If we were still in the late 2000's with only Portal for our first-person physics puzzling fix I would almost recommend this, but with games like Quantum Conundrum and Q.U.B.E providing more polished alternatives I can really only say it's worth a try for the very curious or ardent genre completionists.

To do that, I need to be able to reliably identify and obtain good players.  This isn't that game, and for two reasons:  1) the developer seems to think it's \"fun\" to withhold information and 2) there is some really poor design in this game.\nI'll use the trading system as an example of what I mean.  I once drafted a player that was clearly the best one in the draft.  The problem was, it wasn't a position of need.  No problem.  I had a veteran player in the prime of his career.  I could trade him for similar veteran at a position I do have a need at.  Right?  Not really.  When you bring up the trade screen you're can shop a player around, which brings up a list of teams that are supposively interested.  But if you read what it says, it's only a \"rough estimate\" of their interest.  In other words, they could be yanking  your chain.  And, indeed, that appears to be the case.  After an hour of trying fruitlessly to trade a star player, I offered a clearly advantageous trade that any GM would have leapt at, only to be told they wanted a player with greater impact.  No, I don't like games that jerk me around anymore than I like people who do that to me in real life.  This could all be avoided if I were allowed to ask the question:  what would you trade for this player?  But there's no way to do it.  Because of poor design, I'm left frustrated, angry, and unable to perform what should be a simple task.\nOr consider the draft.  I've gone through a couple dozen drafts, and if there's a way to reliably identify good players, it eludes me -- and, yes, that includes considering combine results.  In real life, if I took over a franchise, I'd immediately beef up the scouting department so I get accurate information from which to make decisions.  IN FOF, it appears that is done through your coaching staff.  The problem is, you can only replace your staff after their contract runs out.  So, if you inherit a coaching staff that doesn't know how to scout and you can't replace them for a few seasons, the predictable result is that you end up drafting stiff after stiff after stiff.  No, I don't consider that fun and, yes, I put considerable time into trying to figure it out.  I've come to the conclusion that the game is designed for failure.\nSo, no, I don't recommend this game.", "hours": 113.5, "user_id": "76561198114334189", "username": "dmcderm", "products": 65, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

This leads to you sometimes pulling yourself towards somewhere, instead of pressing a button or picking something up.\nStory and Setting are generic and not very interesting. The bad voice acting doesn't help either.\nThe only thing making the puzzles challenging is either the physics not cooperating and making it unnecessarily difficult to execute the solution or having to guess what you are supposed to do, because the game does not teach you the required mechanics properly.\nThere's 2 main enemies you encounter throughout the game.\nSome flying drone balls called \"Tracers\" that do not present any challenge at all, because you can easily walk past them and even if they manage to hit you, you will barely take damage. You have to actively walk into them if you want to die. Even if there is more than 1, they will just bunch up to a bigger ball and still be no challenge at all.\nThe second main enemy are the stationary turrets. They are the complete opposite of the drones. One shot from them will instantly kill you. Most of the time you are supposed to distract them with some object and then sneak past them, but 90% of the time that just ends up not working, because either the physics don't cooperate or they decide to see you anyways.\nThere's one smaller explosive orb enemy in one of the latter levels and in the final battle, but they are equally unfair, cause they are way faster than you and once they catched up, they just get stuck around your feet and it is impossible to get them off from you before they explode and just kill you.\nEvery Level basically looks the same and I guess they started running out of ideas for \"puzzles\" in the later parts of the game, because they start reusing some of the earlier ones in the second half. It's also just not very interesting to walk through the same corridors over and over again. You just walk from puzzle to puzzle until you reach the end of the level just to repeat that again in the next level.\nThere is several other things that add up to making this an unbearable experience to play.\nLoading screens take ages (which with the fact that you die alot from all kinds of things, gets very frustrating)\nAlso NO AUDIO SLIDERS AT ALL. You have to go into the windows mixer if you don't want the game to blast your ears out.\nThere's many more things like this, but I don't feel like listing up everything.\nI don't know why I'm writing up this much, because the game certainly doesn't even deserve the time of getting a review written, but I genuinely dislike every aspect of this game and it's one of the worst games I forced myself to play through.\nPlease don't unironically buy this game.", "hours": 12.6, "username": "Dacciox", "products": 357, "early_access": false}

GSTD:RotOL provides you with exactly that experience - one of the twists being maybe a bit unexpected.\nThe incredible visual world of the first game is back in full force, and the naval theme gave the graphics artists some extra legroom, and the two sea-specific levels (Mistral Reefs and Spring Tide Bay) have some really breathtaking sights, even by GSTD standards. The music is a clever combination of three new tunes and some of the old ones, and two of the three new songs are really memorable, while the third is just good. Level design is as megalomaniac as ever, and the gameplay didn't change much, although there are a few new elements, I especially like the tri-color projectile mechanic (ie. reds hurts Cute Giana, yellow hurts Punk, blue hurts both). There's a change in the difficulty, however.\nAfter all the curses GSTD got for the difficulty, especially on World 3, one would think Black Forest would back down a bit. But they did the contrary, actually - 4-1 feels like a direct continuation of 3-9, with the exception of the opening scene, which I found hilarious. Then 4-2 and 4-3 gradually ramps the difficulty upwards, 4-4 dips a little bit, then comes 4-5, the aptly named Black Forest, which is probably the most difficult non-Boss (or more like non-dragon) level in the both games.  I applaud the creators for it, although when I was trying to complete it on Hardcore, I was not exactly applauding :D\nThen, after the fearsome-looking but actually rather tame 4-6, we get to our single boss, the Owlverlord. After the Black Forest, I was wondering how this guy will rate compared to Gurglewocky, but fortunately (or unfortunately), this boss is much easier than the mighty dragon, and while it's harder to figure out than Hansel & Gretel or Octor Freud, once you got the right responses to its moves the fight gets a lot easier. Some of its attacks are spectacular and fun - but in the end, very easy to dodge. It was a slight letfown, but at least no loss of hair :)\nSummary - if you liked the original GSTD, you need Rise of the Owlverlord as well.

I mean, cough, a female protagonist wakes up in a facility, without really knowing what's going on, then being greeted by a robotic voice (less robotic in English than German, I should note) and then being told what to do, which of course, turns out to be a bad idea. SOUNDS FAMILIAR, DON'T IT?\nNow, meet our hero Ashley Simms aka Number Nine aka StonedFace. You'll be seeing her face lots and I mean it. She is all over the main menu, the loading screen, the game's boxart, thumbnail, cutscenes, EVERYWHERE. We get it, she's the only character worth a damn, but cmon, you could at least have hired a better voice actor for her or give her more complex facial animations, something to show us that you really cared about her! But nope, instead we get the same picture every loading screen, one of the worst voice actresses in a video game ever (even worse in German) and this is meant to be their marketing chick. Yeah no, you dropped the ball on that much too hard. So what's in store regarding plot and gameplay?\nLife on the surface is not possible due to critical conditions and the remaining survivors, including Ashley, are put into cryosleep until they can go back to their ordinary lives. But suddenly, we wake up, with a large fraction of our mind erased, in a CONSIDERABLY TIGHT jumpsuit that really marks our *cough* assets. Aside from that, we have a neat-looking pair of gloves that grants us the ability to pull (red) and throw (blue). Instead of portals, you have to use the limited energy stored in your gloves to solve puzzles based on physics, height, gravity and dodging. To be fair, that is indeed an innovative concept and works rather well most of the time, some puzzles are cleverly designed and the subtle use of the soundtrack fits the atmosphere perfectly. In general, the controls are simple, easy to master and to learn, as the challenges lie within the countless obstacles you have to overcome.\nAs previously stated, there aren't many voice actors present in the game and not many characters to begin with and they still couldn't come up with some sort of workaround to make them sound more natural. The presentation feels too stale, the texture work is repeating itself from level to level, the story doesn't try to expand on what is already known, the ending is a cliffhanger building up for a sequel that obviously never came, the cutscenes are blocky and years behind the 2009 standard, you can find grammatical errors in subtitles and there is no replay value except the unlockable Hardcore mode that lets you play with quicksaves disabled. Meh. You will too encounter bugs such as pickups not being highlighted, flames not being rendered or objects getting stuck and THE GAME PROMPTS YOU TO SNEAK AROUND TURRETS WHEN IT'S NOT EVEN POSSIBLE. Ugh...\nI completed it twice, on both modes and I have to admit, the second run was more pleasurable to do as I knew how the mechanics worked perfectly. But it remains a budget project that I cannot recommend UNLESS you want to be reminded how great Portal is. It's really good. Go buy that instead.

The physics oriented gameplay means deaths and setbacks are plenty.\nConclusion: Platforming in physics oriented corridor walker can make or break a game, and while the mechanics in this case actually work as intended, they are not engaging at all.

You are a young man with a business that is in trouble, and you're trying to get help from your mother-in-law.  Toward this end you're visiting an antique shop looking for a gift to put her in a good mood.  The shopkeeper has a story to tell about every single item in his shop.  After examining an item, talk with the mother-in-law to attempt to persuade her.\nAn interesting concept with annoying execution.  You will wind up doing the same sequence over and over and over and over again: walk into shop, hear story about item, walk into mother-in-law's office, pick item in room to discuss, have conversation, more often than not get turned down.  The conversations can be skipped through, but they're still lengthy.  Charting the different conversation paths alone isn't sufficient to get a successful outcome.  I eventually found a walkthrough to explain what I had to do to get what.\nI kept asking myself, \"Why is this necessary?\"  The stories the shopkeeper has for the items, and the suggestion of his own backstory, are intriguing, but hearing one involves the entire sequence of events.  Why can't the guy just stand there and find out about each and every item?  If for whatever reason he's not going to ask about an item, why must he go to the shop at all each iteration?

I was wrong. It's not completely terrible and it's obvious that some real work went into it based on the fantastic art and suitable music, but what starts as an interesting story quickly falls apart when you realise just how short a single playthrough can be. I finished my first run in about 20 minutes, with making some mistakes and having to retry some choices, and when I did finish it I was left immensely unfulfilled, as if I'd seen a single episode of an anime expecting more only to be told \"Nope, that's it for these characters.\" Clearly the intent was to have the player keep replaying it and discover every single ending to make up an appropriate amount of in game time for the price tag, but after getting 8 of them and learning that many contain the same scenes and dialogue (more so than most CYOA titles I've played) I think it'd be a mind numbing slog to push through all the content this game does have. After letting it idle long enough to get my last card drop, I think I'll be done with it. I will say though, that for the CYOA portions there was a nice element of suspense whenever you found yourself in a new situation.\nIt certainly doesn't help that the romance angle is somewhat flawed at best, and not just for how quickly the two characters seem to fall in love. I thought it was weird but alright given the short length per playthrough up until I got an ending that made me realise just how awful Gavin really is. He went from lonely outcast in need of a friend to weird guy who thinks he's entitled to a tradwife but has put no effort into being someone that any woman would like, let alone the one of his dreams. Furthermore, he seems to be taking advantage of a naive teenage girl who's just lost her only surviving parent and I think he knows it. I wouldn't be surprised to find out he watched her while she slept for a while before waking her up. The guy is a creep, plain and simple. There's no real way to tell him no either, which is gross.\nAnother big issue I have with this is the fact that our heroine, the woman warrior who some of us are excited to play as, is quickly made into a supporting character while Gavin gets to be the star and does all the cool stuff. That's not even close to empowering, which an experience like this should be. She's also presented as extremely one dimensional and boring with no personality to speak of. This game misses the mark pretty badly all around in my opinion, with it's few highlights not being nearly enough to outweigh all the bad. Might be worth it when it's on sale for the achievements and trading cards, but otherwise don't bother.", "hours": 1.5, "user_id": "76561198196490709", "username": "Ithaqua", "products": 638, "early_access": false}

Build and expand your postal service enterprise, opening offices and managing staff, vehicles and service coverage while competing with other organizations.\nYou start with a single post office, and can open additional offices as new locations periodically become available. Each office will cover an amount of city blocks based on the office size. You must then hire clerks and mail sorters, as well as upgrade each office with various objects.\nA fleet of vehicles may be purchased and assigned to either pick up or deliver mail, packets or postal cards. Each vehicle has a different speed, fuel cost, carrying capacity and quantity of blocks it can be assigned to. Vehicles and office upgrades are unlocked from stars you get from completing objectives, delivering priority parcels or having a good weekly performance when compared to competitors.\nThere are three office sizes, the larger they are and the more vehicles, employees and wider coverage you get. Every day, new office locations may unlock, others may have been acquired by competitors. Office coverage overlap is inevitable and required, as you will need to specialize each office (mailing, parcel delivery or post cards), the limited vehicle and employee capacity preventing from you from having only a few large offices that do everything. As time passes, the three cities on the map expand with additional city blocks, unlocking either more offices or potential customers.\nYou're given access to a good variety of vehicles. As their run around the map, you can see how much capacity they are using (although regular mail seems to count as 0% no matter how many you have), making it easy to see when a vehicle is unable to support its workload and needs to be replaced with a larger one. You can see your competitor's offices on the map, as well as their vehicle type and cargo type, making it simple to gage their coverage and service offering, useful considering their company information is confidential, beyond their total delivery quantity.\nCompetitors cannot be dealt with in any way: you cannot hinder them, you cannot buy them out, they are there and that's it. Reports are extremely vague and give you no indicator on how to better compete, it just says you lost points due to competition. There's no information on prices either, no feedback to know if you're too low, and if customers complain you're too high, it doesn't clarify if it pertains to letters, packets or express cargo. This makes the competitive aspect of the game very lame and inactive, so you'll quickly outright ignore competitors presence beyond hurrying to expand faster in order to deliver more mail than they do.\nOffices and vehicles sizes cannot be upgraded. If you need a larger office, you must sell your existing office and repurchase it by selecting a larger model. This is infuriating, as staff and vehicles are locked to your offices, forcing you to repurchase all your vehicles, staff and office upgrades all over again and set routes and tasks from scratch. Once an office has received all its upgrades, which can be unlocked and purchased very early in the game, there is nothing more to do with it, besides occasionally replacing used vehicles or hiring additional staff (assuming you haven't maxed it out already) for rush periods during holidays.\nThe isometric map is fairly small, consisting of three towns, no landscape to speak of (flat green fields with scattered pine trees, no mountains or lakes of any kind). You will quickly reach a point where you have nothing more to do besides hope that, hours later at max speed, additional city blocks are built requiring you to repeat the \"build office, hire staff, purchase vehicles, set tasks\" routine you go through with every new office you open. This gets boring very quickly, as there's a terrible lack of variety, you'll see all the game has to offer quickly and won't feel inclined to replay it.\nI don't see how I can recommend this game. It just feels lackluster, a pityful fraction of what a game the likes of\nachieved years ago.

The fact you cant judge talent to draft along with the salary cap.. makes mistakes in drafting.. harsh.. which is fine.. thats reality.. but not being able to better judge talent in the draft is a MAJOR drawback & makes me dislke playing. There are many leagues available to join, (i was hoping to make my own with my fantasy buddies), not sure how they deal with the lack/ insufficent pre draft info.

{"product_id": "27900", "page": 4, "page_order": 2, "recommended": false, "date": "2017-03-19", "text": "Millennia ago, before the advent of Steam Greenlight or even user reviews, it was rare to find a title on the platform that was just outright bad. There was a small selection of underwhelming titles to be had, though, and Twin Sector could always be found circling the drain of that particular tub. I never knew why or even what it was really about, other than being a first-person puzzle game akin to Portal. A small part of me held out hope that it was just misunderstood or interestingly flawed (I foolishly hold this hope for all of Steam's Weeklong Deal underclass). Now that I've spent some time with it I understand exactly why it has the reputation it does, and why I can tell you to stay the hell away from it.\nTwin Sector casts you as Ashley Simms, a lumpy Poser vixen that just happens to be cool and good at everything, from professional sports to saving orphans. The six and a half minute cutscene the game opens with has her being fawned over by some future space military before being shipped off to cryosleep in a station orbiting Earth to wait out the end of global warming or whatever other MAN-MADE disaster boned the planet. She awakens face-first on the floor, suffering from plot amnesia that the station's gormless AI is happy to selectively fill her in on. The place is falling apart and she just happens to be up and about, so get ready to flip a lot of switches in inexplicable positions.\n\"Gormless\", by the way, is an adjective that describes something \"lacking intelligence\" and also happens to be the perfect descriptor of this game. Twin Sector is ostensibly a puzzle game, equipping you with glowy space gloves that can push or pull things at a distance and expecting you to negotiate puzzle rooms with them. In practice this means three things: Force-jumping up to high ledges, cushioning long falls so falling damage doesn't kill you, and hucking barrels and garbage balls at switches. None of the halls or chambers of Twin Sector present much challenge in sussing out WHAT you have to do or HOW you have to do it, only in getting your stupid gloves to do what you HAVE to do. Puzzles tend to be little more than finding the hatch or pipe or switch you need to get to to proceed, sometimes requiring boxes to block deadly lasers or explosive barrels to break doors with.\nI really cannot overstate how dull and unengaging every aspect of Twin Sector is but by God I'm going to try. Every single one of the game's 17 levels is comprised entirely of featureless concrete or featureless metal, with the occasional pipe or fluorescent light to give any sense of immersion. Rooms make absolutely no sense as actual places, with elevator buttons stuck to 20-foot ceilings and computer consoles on ledges with no perceptible access.

The only thing you'll get more of as you progress is frustration as the puzzles introduce more and more ways to kill you for not doing exactly what you have to do. It's all the more frustrating when the answers are apparent and the execution is what, well, executes you, and that's the case for almost every challenge.

There are many ideas in the game that are poorly executed, leading to a bland \"puzzle\" experience that, contrary to what puzzles should be, is very easy and straightforward on the puzzle part, but very hard and frustrating in the places it shouldn't be. The basic premise is that you have a glove which can repel or attract objects and also drag you to or push you away from walls and such. But there are many problems with this basic concept.\nExample: Fall damage that kills you when you fall one meter. You are supposed to soften the fall with your gloves, except sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Why? No clue. Why I die when jumping from a one meter high wall when in real life I would be fine? No clue.\nI gave up at chapter 7/17 when turrets were introduced. The way to destroy them is awfully inconsistent (throwing exploding barrels at them that they don't shoot 90 % of the time) and they can track and shoot you before you can react. You are supposed to be able to sneak past them by walking slowly with the SHIFT key, except it doesn't work half the time.\nIn summary, the game has a few cool ideas but none of them are executed in any satisfying way. It is a bland, samey experience that is too often too frustrating and very inconsistent when it comes to the mechanics that need to ALWAYS work to create a good game.\nPersonal Score: 2.5/10", "hours": 3.1, "user_id": "76561198025321433", "username": "Yarusenai", "products": 843, "early_access": false}

Many would be quick to compare it to the Portal series, and I can understand why. The premise is you being stuck in a facility with an AI buddy navigating you through puzzles, while you make use of a dual functioned device. However, the more I played Twin Sector, I increasingly found that most comparisons between Twin Sector and Portal are merely ignorant, pointing out only very slim similarities, while ignoring the bigger picture.\nTwin Sector is really a game about isolation, delving into the mind of a woman thrown into a strange, cold world that does not look inhabitable whatsoever. All the while, she is being bossed around by disembodied male voices, bossing her around but without having any warmth or liveliness to them. In a world where she is the only person, she has to solve all of the problems in the facility. But... do these problems even exist? The only evidence of their existence is the robotic men who speak to her through the intercoms. For all we, the player, know, these issues may not even be real, and they may be lying to her, to exploit her and to display power over her.\nThis is where Twin Sector shines.

Additionally the game returns very little feedback and loops on itself at odd and sometimes different moments. The underlying scripting is hard to pinpoint but the effects it produces are clearly flavorless and disjointed. The voice acting is amateur and there is next to no sound signature to the game, with an absence of music and very few sound effects. In some instances the dialogue seems to fail and the customer wastes time going to other shops before the game loops again, in other instances the customer comes back to look at a different piece yet the same dialogue puzzle loops again which feels like this game's equivalent to a game over screen.

And now that I've found it again, well... I can finally make my review of it.\nSword Daughter places you in the role of Tyrna, a young woman who is traveling with her father, a great general, to participate in a competition/games alongside him.  However... disaster strikes, and a rampaging horde of orcs end up attacking the caravan, slaughtering everything and everyone within it- except for our valiant heroine, who is struck on the head by a stray weapon blow.\nComing to, she finds herself rescued by Gavin, a half-elf ranger who happened to be patrolling nearby, and apparently-\nNo.  I can't go on like this, not any longer.  I can't hold back the review I really want to do for this game.\nThis game, this VN... is absolute garbage.  If you're looking to buy it simply based upon the fact the main character is a badass female warrior, well... you don't get to show many of your skills off.  In fact, 90% of the time, pulling out your sword is a terrible idea, and will get you hurt, killed, or some other terrible thing happening to you.  So what are you supposed to do, in this story, if not to fight?\nIf you've ever played Pathfinder or D&D with a female player/character at the table, and ever run into one of those guys who immediately start trying to convince her that they shouldn't be rushing into combat, that they should just be in the back and maybe even reroll as a healer or mage if they're going to insist on playing (with a high charisma score so he can hit on them), and that no matter what they should consult with him first because he'll show them how to make their character amazing?  And by the way, his character constantly protects and shows off and can't shut up about how she should just listen to him because she's not cut out to be frontline or even have a say in what she does except if it's to fall in wuv with him?\nYep.  Gavin is like super-concentrated That Guy.\nThe ways to the \"good\" endings are simple- you bow your head and you listen to whatever Gavin tells you to do.  If he tells you that women aren't meant to play with weapons and be warriors, you're supposed to listen to him and go home to learn how to be a dutiful housewife- there's even an ending where he throws Tyrna over his shoulder and implies he's going to imprison her in his home so he and his mother can \"teach\" her what her place truly is- his loving waifu, because girls shouldn't be warriors.\nYep.  This book was apparently based off a CYOA-style book from the early 80s, and boy, does it sure read like it, to its enormous detriment.\nNo matter what you do- if you try to sneak into a camp?  Gavin does it better and he's the one to do all the fighting.  If you try to fight the orc that killed your father?  Nope, Gavin gets to go in and do it and be all flashy and impressive so he can show Tyrna she should rather be a housewife so he can wuv and protect her.   There is an ending where you can go kill the orc that killed your father, but does Tyrna find grim satisfaction in a job done so her father can rest?\nNope.  Gavin gets all grumpy and whiny, Tyrna ends up feeling nothing but sick to her stomach because vengeance leaves her with a foul taste in her mouth and a terrible feeling in her heart, and she hitches a ride to the next city or wherever with what's left of the caravan while realizing that maybe Gavin was right and she should have listened to the extremely hot elf a lot more, and I think she gives up her career as a warrior.\nI think there's just one ending to this game that doesn't leave an absolutely terrible taste in my mouth:\nAs you adventure through the caves with Gavin, you can end up stumbling across Slag, an ancient blue dragon chained in place by someone or something.  Now, normally, you listen to Gavin and try to double-team the ancient dragon (which turns into him grabbing you and Gavin- of course- busting out leet moves and soloing the ancient dragon without you lifting a finger- no, I'm serious, he solos the ancient evil dragon with a silver sword)- but in an offshoot ending, you can agree to a deal with Slag to allow you to survive- you undo his chains, and go off with him to destroy the surrounding countryside while getting to sport some pretty nice armor.\nAs for positives?  Well, the art is nice, and the script is clean and free of errors, but... that's about it.  And it's only a five-spot in price, and short enough that you can burn through this turd-pile in less than two hours so you can 100% it and send it back for a refund, and all you're out is the soul-crushing hour you wasted playing this trashheap- and it goes on sale occasionally so your outlay is usually less than that.\nThe real shame of this game is that Hanako Games is also the maker of such games as the Magical Diary series, which just launched a sequel (Wolf Hall), and as of today (2/19/2020), the original Magical Diary game, which ALSO has a female MC, is less than this pile of garbage.\nAvoid this hunk of crap at all costs.  2/10- even if it's crap, it's still playable crap.", "hours": 1.4, "username": "JaysonFour", "products": 910, "early_access": false}

It refers to the player character, Tyrna, even though she's just a side character in the adventures of dreamy half-elf Gavin. In the first route I found, they have about two conversations, both of which have Tyrna saying that she wants to go get revenge for her father and is annoyed that Gavin's saying it's too dangerous, and then Tyrna bumps her head and Gavin says \"I'm taking you to my home\" and they kiss. Ugh.\nEvery route that doesn't end with Tyrna dying or being cursed, ends with her hooking up with Gavin, no matter how little sense it makes. If you say you'll go on without him, he'll stalk you and show up a paragraph later like this was his idea all along. If you split up, Gavin will find you as soon as is narratively convenient. If you try to separate yourself from Gavin, the narrative will eventually punish you with one of the aforementioned deaths or curses.\nThis wouldn't be nearly so bad if Gavin was a better person and a better character. He's a pretty boring character, with his only character traits being badassery, falling in love with Tyrna for ill-explained reasons, and attempts to control Tyrna that keep being framed as nothing more than concern. Even though he pretty consistently criticizes and insults her any time she goes against what he says, initiates intimacy without bothering to ask for consent, and generally assumes he knows best in the relationship. Like Tyrna's a child he just has to protect. And don't get me started on his constant, obnoxious efforts to pamper a woman who clearly wants to be treated as an equal.\nAnd, of course, the narrative supports this. It's okay that Gavin tells Tyrna what to do, because he's right; he's an awesome elf, and she's just a puny human girl. It's okay that Gavin keeps ignoring Tyrna's requests to shoulder her share of the load, because she bonked her head. It's okay that Gavin smooches her without making sure that this surly young woman wants a smooch, because the internal narration has been hinting that Tyrna has the hots for Gavin with all the subtlety Michael Bay could muster, and no need to have her actually say any of that. Ugh.\nAnd then there's the plot. Tyrna tries to sneak into the orc camp? Gavin somehow snuck in behind you, even if he was cowering from a stampede of oxen and you have the cloak of concealment. Tyrna confronts the leader of the brigands? Gavin shows up before Sword Daughter has to draw her sword and lets her spectate. Find an evil cultist guy? Gavin fights him, chases him into the lake, and drives him into the water beetles. When there's a big fight scene Gavin usually lets Tyrna participate a little, though there's decent odds she'll be left to spectate by some event outside his control...and, of course, Gavin always does the badass stuff. I haven't found the ending where Tyrna confronts the orc who killed her dad, but given how every other plot point of import has wound up, I expect some kind of contrivance to give Gavin an excuse to take Tyrna's revenge for her.\nAfter all, who picks up a game called Sword Daughter hoping to play a badass warrior woman?

Well, seven seasons later, that DE has earned 4 bowl rings, and countless accolades while terrorizing the league. All while your 1st round bust (had a minor red flag you ignored) has battled off-field problems (illegal firearms possesion, tobacco addiction- yes, while somewhat rare, this can happen) and has been traded three times in seven years.\nYou won the superbowl? Great! But now your franchise running back wants a raise...and so does your all-league defensive player of the year. Can't afford it? Time to make cuts or trades. And it's not just the salary cap you have to watch when you make changes. You have positional chemistry and leadership to worry about as well. You finally find a decent veteran running back witth leadership and mentoring capabilities (helps with performance and development for the backfield group). Awesome! Downside? Your starting fullback and young, promising back-up running back hate him. YES, THIS GAME IS THAT DEEP.\nYou can automate almost everything if you wish. Hiring some decent coaches really helps in this area. However, auto-tasking and blindly simulating will greatly diminish what this game is all about. For me personally, taking on every decision in running a franchise for decades is pretty daunting. Having the flexibility to toggle AI assistance on and off gives my brain a break, and allows me to focus on areas of the game I like most. That's the beauty of the game. You can simulate seasons in minutes or review scouting material, game plan, and call every play of every game.\nPros:\n+ statistics galore. Everything and anything you can think of...it is all here.\n+ create your own living, breathing league. Watch it grow and evolve for as many years as you like.\n+ AI assistance with different areas of the game. Sure, it could always use more polish, but by and large, it is excellent. I would challenge you to find a better engine.\nCons:\n- the interface. It is old. It is clunky. You can get used to it, but even when you do, there are things that you just wished were more streamlined (It would be nice if there was a search button or player comparison feature). You spend more time then needed toggling back and forth between screens then there needs to be.\n- Tutorial. There is none. You can find some of what you need at the bottom of some of the pop-up screens. But that's it. You can find some info on old message boards and threads, but it can be quite a chore to find what you need. I'm still finding out new things and I'm more than 80 hours in.\n- Minor ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•...the holes for playcalling are not your traditional even numbers on the right and odd numbers on the left. YOU CAN'T JUST JUMP INTO THIS GAME. It requires hunting down information and meticulously reading every bit of small print on every screen. There are differences in the solecismic universe. You need to be aware of what they are (another example of this is that in a 3-4 defense, your weakside linebacker is considered part of the pass rush. They won't ever be in coverage).\nAll in all, this is the deepest American Football game on the market. You can certainly get used to the interface, but I do hope the developer makes improvements to it. Would I love to see a match engine like in Football Manager or Eastside Hockey League? Absolutely. But, if that can't happen, then streamlining and updating the interface to make it easier to find information and be more aesthetically pleasing would make the next iteration a better seller.", "hours": 104.8, "user_id": "76561198029704499", "username": "tora75", "products": 242, "early_access": false}

It's entertaining for a few hours, but it falls flat when compared to other Nancy Drew titles (like Curse of Blackmoor Manor or the Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon, to name a few).\nCompared to other Nancy Drew games, the story is very shallow (at least to me) and the characters lacked their usual backstory. Their dialogue doesn't amount to much, and the characters feel very static (you only see them in one place or so, until close to the end of the game).\nPersonally, I found the map system very messy and an unnecessary addition. There are many locations listed but you only unlock a handful, and the world feels very small. There isn't much to explore, and it seems most of the events are triggered by the storyline, and not from exploring too (like in other ND games).\nThe graphics are decent and the game itself runs smoothly, even on an older laptop which is a plus. Steam overlay never works for me with older ND games, though it could be different for someone else.\nUnlike other Nancy Drew titles, this one really isn't scary. Phantom of Venice would suit younger children, though they might need help with some of the harder puzzles. The last one took me awhile, even using a guide - it was fun nonetheless, and perfectly suitable if you want to finish a game in a night or two.\nDo I rec it as a Nancy Drew game? No - I'd say skip this one unless you buy it on sale, and even then, don't expect much.

The puzzles it offers are ludicrously easy to solve as an intellectual challenge, yet mindboggingly hard to pull off as far as physics are concerned. That is the fault of the way the game handles the physics, the slowness of the main character, the unresponsiveness of the game to input, and the fact that you have to be very precise in how long you press a mouse button without there being good feedback on that.\nTwin Sector is a death simulator. You die. A LOT. You die several times on each JUMP. You die several times when confronted by each of the numerous turrets and tracers. You die every time you encounter another laser field. You die even when you jump off a platform that is three meters above the floor. That would still not be too bad if the game had a good autosave system and quick loads, but it loads terribly slowly and its autosaves are rare. You have a quicksave (not a regular save, unfortunately), but you should be very careful in using it because it is surprisingly easy to maneuver yourself into a position from which the game is unsolvable.\nThe voice acting is godawful, the animations are stiff, and the environments look like they were taken from a standard Unity library. The background story is not a bad idea to base a game on, but the background of the heroine is deploringly annoying (\"Oh, Ashley, you are such a big hero, we all admire you so much.\" Bluergh). Those elements are all acceptable if the gameplay is good. Unfortunately, it is not. Twin Sector is a frustrating mess.\nI cannot recommend Twin Sector. It is too bad, because a lot of effort of several reasonably talented people was invested in creating this game. However, none of these people seemed to have any insight in what makes a game fun. I played half of the game before giving up. I do not like to repeat over, and over, and OVER again section after section because I die constantly.

They are without a doubt the easiest engine to make an RPG in, to the point that anyone can make an RPG with them... so there are admittedly some sub-par games out there which have given RPG Maker a poor reputation to some. But the massive quantity of games made in RPG Maker games do not speak for the quality of the engine negatively, they show how incredible the engine is at doing it's job of being easy enough that anyone can use it, and flexible and fully editable enough that any game can be made.\nThe *major* drawback of using RPG Maker that all new game devs should be aware of is that it is difficult to port games to non-PC platforms, especially for VX Ace, which requires doing something ridiculous like making a custom game interpreter and wrapping your game inside of it (there is *no* support for other platforms, and no one using VX Ace should *expect* to be able to publish their game on other platforms even though it is theoretically possible and you may see that such an environment does currently exist if you do some searching online). Support for other platforms by other RPG Maker versions is barely better than none, with MV pulling ahead of MZ in that department.\nSo while I would even say that VX Ace is arguably a better tool than MV or MZ, and that any RPG Maker editor is by far and away the easiest way to make an RPG if your game so much as vaguely resembles any previous RPG out there or you just want to make a game with an intuitive database GUI tool already created for you--be cautious before spending your time learning this engine, and reflect on what your end goals for your project and personal growth as a developer are, and how important supporting different platforms is to you.", "hours": 4916.2, "user_id": "76561198052357780", "username": "zadck1", "products": 73, "early_access": false}

Something to spend an hour , before moving on to other matters.\nLittle did I know what broiling, seething, endless amounts of hatred this game would inspire. The voice acting is grating and repetitive. It is easily ignored at first, but after a while you hear them say the exact same thing over and over again. There are limited choices you see, and each of them as meaningless as the last.\nWhat item you choose in the shop means nothing. It just has a meaningless bit of trivia attached to it. One you will hear over and over again, as sometimes seemingly at random you will start outside of the store and instead of going in, the game chooses an item for you. You start knowing each item by heart and hating yourself for it.\nThe dialogue with the mother in law is equally meaningless. The only ending in the game which seems remotely entertaining is where she dies. None of the characters are remotely interesting or evoke the slightest bit of sympathy or engagement. The protagonist is a shiftless, whiny, useless man who his wife probably married to spite her mother. Understandable, as the mother is a shrill harpy whose voice slowly makes one wish for blunt cranial trauma. The best character is the shopkeeper, for he is only ineffectual instead of being an outright blight on humanity. To add injury to insult, I think I made the characters twice as interesting as they are in the actual game..\nTo make this game palatable, I would suggest the following.\n1. If one is outside the store, allow one to simply skip to be within it. You already heard everything the flower shop guy had to say.\n2. Always allow one to choose your item. That is the point yes?\n3. Let people change perspective themselves.\n4. Provide subtitles\n5.

{"product_id": "342450", "page": 3, "page_order": 7, "recommended": true, "date": "2018-05-27", "text": "Sword Daughter is a fantasy adventure visual novel developed by Hanabira and published by Hanako Games. As a burgeoning warrior Tyrna, daughter of the great general Hamroth, is traveling through a vast desert with her father on the way to compete in the annual Warrior Games. As the traveling caravan they are accompanying makes camp for the night it is suddenly and unsuspectingly besieged upon by a marauding band of vicious Orcs who begin killing everyone in sight. Your beloved father quickly manages to safely hide you under a Cloak of Concealment before he himself is murdered defending the caravan during the brutal attack. Even concealed, Tyrna manages to catch a blow to the head from a wildly swinging weapon during the melee and falls to the ground still hidden yet unconscious and left for dead. A short time later and still alive, young Tyrna must learn to fend for herself in the world and make some substantial choices as she vows to track down her fathers killers and rescue the remaining but captured caravaners. Prepare to follow Tyrna on a grand adventure filled with glorious battle, powerful magic, riches beyond belief and romance as she makes meaningful choices while living the life of a swordswoman. This visual novel is a licensed recreation of an original choose-your-own-adventure fantasy book from the 1980's with all new picturesque artwork and a fantastic soundtrack.\nVisually, this novel's presentation is simply breathtaking. The outstanding artwork is of the upmost quality with superb illustrations laden with beautiful colors and shading. I'm also quite happy to report that the artstyle in this title is NOT manga-inspired, not that I don't like that particular type of illustration as I very much do but it's just nice to read a visual novel on Steam from time to time that steps away from that prevalent method of art. Aurally, this V.N. is just as superb as there are an abundance of ambient sound effects present that really immerse you quite well into the story. Also, the soundtrack itself is very impressive and blends in nicely with the narrative whether you are traversing through a barren desert, engaging combatants or witnessing a rather emotional moment in the novel. The overall user interface is simple and easy to use which allows you to focus on the reason that you are here for in the first place which is the captivating narrative. In summary, Sword Daughter puts forth a very impressive visual and aural presentation for this quite interesting visual novel experience.\nSeeing as how I couldn't get my hands on enough copies of choose-your-own adventure books to peruse, I completely loved the story in Sword Daughter and the nostalgia that it awakened in me for that particular genre of reading. There was always just something so spectacular about the choose-your-own adventure books and this visual novel managed to capture that \"special something\" perfectly. If you like to read and have never experienced this genre before then I wholeheartedly suggest that you give it a try because you won't be dissapointed. With that said, replayability is quite high as the very nature of choose-your-own adventure books warrant such a thing. As far as options go, there are numerous Steam Achievements to hunt down and Steam Trading Cards to collect as well. The title also has basic game options like sound/volume control, text speed and language selection. Also, there is a C.G. gallery that unlocks as the story progresses, an Achievement screen to keep track of your various accomplishments in the novel, a section map for determining the choices that you selected in order to help you get to the twenty two different endings and a jukebox for the wonderfully orchestrated soundtrack. In the end, this V.N. does a wonderful job of taking you on a fantastic journey packed with combat, intrigue, romance and choice which is what any worthy visual novel should be capable of doing therefore Sword Daughter is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to any fan of the genre.", "hours": 2.7, "username": "œÅ–æ—ïŒπ—Ç—è–æ–∏_", "products": 648, "early_access": false}

Each just has a major theme change and setting for a different era, or a different war.\nI agree with one comment that Wings over Europe is pretty much Strike Fighters, but I would have preferred Wings over Israel or Wings over Vietnam to depict wars that actually happened, rather than the hypothetical cold war campaigns.\nIn fact, I don't know why Third Wire and/or Strategy First didn't reissue all the versions on Steam. It would have been great to collect and replay these titles, or better yet have them in a bundle.\nAnyway, I give this game the thumbs up for being a great simulation for its time...10 years ago. Also, it is fairly accurate in its depiction of air warfare, including air combat and strike. Another element is that there is something about how they have crafted it with mission background, situation briefings, mission planning, etc.; along with the flight dynamics and real world limitations that make it feel authentic.\nAuthentic to me feels like everytime I play a campaign, and I'm planning and executing a mission, I get a glimpse of what it as like back then flying over the jungle in Vietnam to ripple off a load of 500lb Snakeyes...and completely miss; or erratically jinking over the Suez Canal desperately trying to avoid SA-2 SAMS...and having the stabilizer blow off...\nIt just feels authentic...and doesn't need a lot of glitz and glam that other air combat games have.\nTotally worth it in the $15-20 range (undiscounted), and $20-30 bundle of Wings over Israel, Vietnam, and Strike would be sweet too.\nI haven't tried any of the titles with Windows 10. I don't see the point in an OS change when Windows 7 is so awesome. I should point out that I had no end of technical issues with all the versions of this flight series under Windows 7 using retail disk...I was glad to see the Steam version of WoE had no such issues, which is another reason why I would like the other games on Steam.\nI would expect to see compatibility issue with Windows 10, regardless.", "hours": 1.0, "username": "GrenadeBait", "products": 1393, "early_access": false}

This is amplified by the footstep sounds the devs chose - big fat stompy boots. Walking backwards is like half the speed of walking forward. Mind, this character is supposed to be a trained athlete.\n- The cutscenes are terribly long-winded and drawn out. Especially during the tutorial, the computer keeps taking control away from you to tell you what is actually completely obvious in sight. Even afterwards, the computer keeps talking to you as if you were a child with special needs, and I don't mean in an AI-with-an-attitude-like manner.\n- The physics are dodgy - objects sometimes bounce around as if they weighed nothing, were made from rubber AND had no air resistance whatsoever.\n- Falling threat, the immediate experience how dangerous your current fall is, is nonexistent. There is not enough feedback (cam shake, wind noise) to give proper impression on your fall, so you die, die and die.\n- All sounds and voice-overs are completely void of reverb. At no point in the game (read: the half hour or so I managed to hold out playing this turd) does the sound of voices and noises match the room they happen in. Even a large metal corridor will make the same impression as a sound-proofed cell.\n- The glove mechanics is pointlessly slowed. There is absolutely no reason for the \"recharge time\" other than to draw this game into a tedious crawl.\n- Loading times. With the low quality of graphical assets, resetting to checkpoints should take the blink of an eye, especially from an SSD, but instead one waits for what seems like the regrowing of an eye ... absolutely abyssmal.\nAll of the flaws above could have been fixed with proper game testing which would have made a cool game even with the low-budget mocap or intro cutscene or texture quality.\nSorry, but this game sucks salty monkey balls, and you don't even get to marvel at Ashley's butt.", "hours": 0.6, "user_id": "76561198025693087", "username": "andersenman", "products": 283, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

People also normally complain about this and it being bland, but I think it fits the feeling, setting, and mood of the game\n3) The voice acting, a lot of people give it crap, but I actually like it and think it makes things more believable since they sound like regular people not Hollywood heroes.\n4) The characters, I really like Ashley, Kevin, and Oscar are all very well done\nSadly, preconceived notions probably ruin the game for many people, even if they give it a chance they are going into with the view that it will be a bad game, and then of course they self-fulfill that prophecy because of their negative attitude from the start...", "hours": 18.0, "username": "Pomf666[SFD][ToF-DD-LL]", "products": 2785, "found_funny": 7, "early_access": false}

In this case I did it even when I didn‚Äôt pay much during the winter sale.\nThe Shopkeeper has a neat premise but the execution is horrible. There is not much here but the repetition of the same sequences of three screens with the same short and uninspired lines of dialogue. The gameplay consists of nothing than clicking some random objects, listening to the same repetitive dialogues and waiting for some random achievements to pop up. There‚Äôs neither an enjoyable game nor any meaning or engaging story to witness here. It starts boring and continues being it with no hope for getting something out of the experience, as the game pretty much goes on on its own with the player only clicking randomly on the screen.\nFurthermore, the game mechanics just don‚Äôt work in the way they seem to be meant. They won‚Äôt be explained in any way and therefore you are thrown into the game without anything useful to do and trying to figure out, what there is to do. Unfortunately, there IS nothing to do, really.\nOn top of that, the dialogues are dreadfully written and the voice acting is not very good. Also there are no subtitles which would be very useful. (Note for these las sentences that I am not a native English speaker and therefore have a blurry look on this topic).\nThe art style is neat but gets wasted in the three screens that come over and over again. So the art style gets boring very fast and very undeserved.\nIt is a shame to give this game a bad review seen what it could be, that it looks relatively good and that the premises gameplay and story wise are interesting.

Fits for the game. I have to give credit the \"cheap\" graphical method, which you can see in the game, because of the theatre feeling.\nControls was easy to memorise it. I played it on controller, which was fun to use, however my partner used keyboard, but said no regret for it. Both controlls works just fine.\nSound and music is also works okay in the game, music is fits for action or story telling part, sounds can be repetitive, but nothing too bad to be honest.\nGameplay however is something else. You just go and clear screen, sometimes you do challanges if you want, or step into your spotlight to advance in the story. This is repetitive for a bit, but thankfully the good jokes and mechanisms related to the theatre makes everything more interesting. You can't die in the game, but if the crowd not impressed, you lose. Also doing challanges is important to get charms and for level up. Doing combos and different attacks also boost the mood of the crowd. Basically the game can't be boring.\nLong story short, this is a great game for coop action, however, it is short, and for the price for this game, feels a bit expensive. If it has more content, then I wouldn't say a thing. We played online coop, so don't worry about the missing information about it on the Steam page.

If you're only going for one or two playthroughs, it's pretty solid. It's got a great art style, the sound scape is spot on, and the story telling is engaging.\nI wouldn't recommend it, though, for the reasons below:\nUnfortunately there isn't much of a 'choice' between falling in love with an elven stud and going on your own adventure. Most of the endings result in the two falling in love and herione blindly following Gavin's lead (there is only ONE time in the entire game where you have the option to be forward with him). Some endings the herione is pleased with the outcome and some she's like: uh, wait, hold up. Either way, it gets fairly boring and repetative. Can't we just be friends? Sword buddies? Teach me the elvish ways, not swoop me in your arms and drag me home to your mother.\nAlso the overarching story starts to fall apart the more you play through it. The passage of time is unclear, but the prisoners meet vastly different fates in some of the endings - but when you save them you always save the same dude. Why are the prisoners being moved around so much, why are the prisoners even there, why was the raiding party sent out in the first place? And then there are all these other questions: who is the REAL leader and decision-maker for our evil-doers, why are they even hanging out together, how did they come to set up camp there, WHY ARE THEY BUILDING THE THINGS THEY ARE BUILDING AND WHAT PURPOSE DO THEY EVEN SERVE?? Like?? I have so many more questions and playing more just made me more confused.\nOne last thing: the herione doesn't have much agency. She gets to make a few of the choices, but elf-stud talks more than she does, does all the cool stuff, and generally makes himself out to be an action hero while our herione gets herself into trouble. Like, okay, cool you can do that once or twice but eventually it just gets boring.

This entry in the Strikefighters series is from the time when hundreds of mods were available for this game. Yes, hundreds of mods, and if you search thoroughly these mods are still available. From aircraft (some heli's can be found out there), to map packs to, complete missions and campaigns.  In comparison to SF2 everything in SF2 is now DLC. Mods also worked online so long as the people you were playing with had the same mods. Much like Torchlight. You can also find the map & weapon editors from Strikefighters Project 1 and it works with all non SF2 variants, E.G.: SF: Project 1, SF: Wings Over Europe, SF: Wings Over Vietnam & SF: Isreal 6 Day War. Each aircraft and vehicle in SF has it's own flight/combat characteristics/weapon loadout limitations. So far I have accumulated 5.64gb's of mods with an average of 4mb per aircraft/vehicle & 20mb per complete campaigns & maps.\nAs another reviewer had also mentioned, yes sadly you have to get the updates from the developer site. And another reviewer mentioning to run the executable rather than the steamn link. SF was noted to have issues with newer OS's past XP, but with the needed patch it has cleared up seemingly all those issues. But once you get it to run perfectly, you will find yourself wasting plenty of flight hours destroying all you can see.
